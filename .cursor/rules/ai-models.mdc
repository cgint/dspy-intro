- NEVER use gemini-1.5-* or gemini-2.0-* as it is way old!
- NEVER change the model that the user specified unless specifically asked to do so
- The current state of the art as of 2026 is gemini-3-flash(-preview) - avoid PRO variant
- gemini-2.5-flash is proven and is most cost-efficient - avoid PRO variant
