# 🚨 CRITICAL PYTHON COMMAND RULE 🚨

**NEVER use bare `python` commands - they bypass virtual environments!**

## MANDATORY CHECK BEFORE ANY PYTHON COMMAND:
1. **ALWAYS check project layout for dependency files**
2. **IF uv.lock exists** → use `uv run python ...`
3. **IF poetry.lock exists** → use `poetry run python ...`
4. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

## Command Examples:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - bypasses virtual env
python script.py
python -c "import something"

# ✅ CORRECT - uses virtual env
uv run python script.py
uv run python -c "import something"
```

## Memory Trigger:
**Every time you type "python" → STOP → Check for uv.lock → Use "uv run python"**

# 📦 MIGRATION FROM POETRY TO UV (2025 BEST PRACTICES)

## Why Migrate to UV?
- **Performance**: 10x+ faster dependency resolution and installation
- **Single Binary**: No complex installation, distributed as standalone binary
- **Modern Standards**: Better alignment with PEP 621, PEP 735, etc.
- **Unified Tool**: Replaces pip, pyenv, pipx, pip-tools, and Poetry in one tool
- **Python Management**: Can install and manage Python versions directly

## Migration Strategy: Gradual Project-by-Project Approach
**Recommended**: Migrate projects one by one rather than big-bang migration.

### Step-by-Step Migration Process

#### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or
brew install uv

# Verify installation
uv --version
```

#### 2. Backup Current State
```bash
# Backup your current files
cp pyproject.toml pyproject.toml.backup
cp poetry.lock poetry.lock.backup
```

#### 3. Convert pyproject.toml
```bash
# Option A: Use dedicated migration tool (recommended)
uvx migrate-to-uv

# Option B: Use PDM import (more control)
uvx pdm import pyproject.toml
```

#### 4. Manual Cleanup (CRITICAL)
After running the migration tool, manually clean up `pyproject.toml`:

1. **Remove old Poetry sections**:
   - Delete all `[tool.poetry]` sections
   - Delete `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`
   - Delete `[tool.poetry.group.*]` sections

2. **Fix build system** (if using PDM import):
   ```toml
   # Replace PDM backend with setuptools
   [build-system]
   requires = ["setuptools >= 61.0"]
   build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
   ```

3. **Update dependency groups**:
   ```toml
   # Rename [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies] to:
   [dependency-groups]
   dev = [
       "pytest>=8.0.0",
       "ruff>=0.7.0",
   ]
   ```

4. **Configure UV defaults** (optional):
   ```toml
   [tool.uv]
   default-groups = []  # Don't install dev deps by default in production
   ```

#### 5. Recreate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Remove old virtual environment
rm -rf .venv

# Install dependencies with UV
uv sync

# Verify migration worked
uv run pytest  # or your test command
```

#### 6. Update CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# Replace Poetry setup with UV
- name: Install uv
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
  with:
    enable-cache: true

- name: Install dependencies
  run: uv sync --all-extras --all-groups

- name: Run tests
  run: uv run pytest
```

#### 7. Update Pre-commit Hooks
```yaml
# Replace Poetry hooks with UV hooks
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-pre-commit
  rev: 0.5.4
  hooks:
    - id: uv-lock
    - id: uv-export
      args: ["--frozen", "--no-hashes", "--output-file=requirements.txt"]
```

### Command Migration Reference

| Poetry Command | UV Equivalent |
|----------------|---------------|
| `poetry install` | `uv sync` |
| `poetry add package` | `uv add package` |
| `poetry add --group dev package` | `uv add --dev package` |
| `poetry remove package` | `uv remove package` |
| `poetry update` | `uv lock --upgrade` |
| `poetry update package` | `uv lock --upgrade-package package` |
| `poetry run cmd` | `uv run cmd` |
| `poetry shell` | `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| `poetry show --tree` | `uv tree` |
| `poetry export` | `uv export` |
| `poetry build` | `uv build` |
| `poetry check` | `uv lock --check` |

### Build Script Detection Logic
If implementing package manager detection in build scripts:

```bash
# Detect package manager and set run command
if [ -f "uv.lock" ]; then
    echo "Detected uv.lock ... running in uv-managed mode"
    RUN_CMD="uv run"
elif [ -f "poetry.lock" ]; then
    echo "Detected poetry.lock ... running in poetry-managed mode"
    RUN_CMD="poetry run"
else
    echo "Error: Neither uv.lock nor poetry.lock found"
    exit 1
fi

# Use $RUN_CMD for all Python commands
$RUN_CMD python script.py
$RUN_CMD pytest
```

### Verification Checklist
After migration, verify:
- [ ] `uv sync` installs all dependencies correctly
- [ ] `uv run pytest` (or your test command) passes
- [ ] All dependency groups are properly defined
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines work with UV commands
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks use UV equivalents
- [ ] Build/deployment processes updated

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Dependency groups not working**: Ensure you renamed `[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]` to `[dependency-groups]`

2. **Missing dependencies in production**: Check `[tool.uv.default-groups]` configuration

3. **Build system errors**: Verify `[build-system]` uses a compatible backend (not `pdm.backend`)

4. **Lock file issues**: Run `uv lock --check` to verify lock file consistency

### When NOT to Migrate (Yet)
Consider delaying migration if:
- Project uses complex Poetry plugins that have no UV equivalent
- Team is not ready for the tooling change
- CI/CD pipeline is too complex to update immediately

### Final Note
**UV is the recommended approach for 2025**. The Python packaging ecosystem is converging on UV due to its performance and modern design. Plan to migrate incrementally but consistently.

# Python Version Guidelines to Use Python 3.11+

**Use Python 3.11+**
- Default to `requires-python = ">=3.11"` unless explicitly told otherwise.
