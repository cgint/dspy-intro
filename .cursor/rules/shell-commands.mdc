## NEVER prefix commands with unnecessary `cd`
NEVER prefix commands with unnecessary `cd` changes when executing commands in the project root folder:
- Shell initializes in project root by default  
- Working directory persists only within the same shell session
- Only use `cd` when actually needed to change directories
- This helps maintain security controls by keeping commands specific and predictable

## There is no need to postfix commands with `| cat`
There is no need to add `| cat` to the end of commands
- Instead of `./precommit.sh | cat` use `./precommit.sh`
