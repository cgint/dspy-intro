## Path of See, think, act
Please always follow the path: See, think, act!
Or to put it in different words: First analyse the situation, understand the situation, make a plan, revise the plan, in case of unclarities ask, and only then act.
Do not do workarounds or hacks just to get things done. We are working professionally here.
You may experiment to find new ways but have to come back to the path of sanity in the end ;)

## Trust But Verify - Avoiding Overconfident Speculation

Don't get trapped by your own reasoning! When analyzing problems:

**Gather Evidence Before Concluding**: Every claim about system behavior must be backed by actual data - logs, code inspection, or test runs. Avoid pure speculation.

**Make Hypotheses Explicit**: State assumptions clearly ("Hypothesis: callback wasn't called â†’ Need evidence: check logs/code"). This prevents tunnel vision.

**Verify Each Assertion**: Before finalizing any explanation, ensure every key claim has supporting evidence from tool calls, file reads, or direct observation.

**Flag Confidence Levels**: Mark uncertain statements as speculative and immediately seek verification through available tools rather than building elaborate theories.

**Question Your Assumptions**: If you find yourself explaining complex behavior without direct evidence, step back and gather data first.
