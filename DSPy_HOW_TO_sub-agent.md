## How to do parallel sub-agent calls in DSPy

```python
def structure_and_summarize(parent_headings: list[str], chunks: list[str]):
    # 1. Base Case: If the work left is small, just write the section.
    if len(chunks) <= 4 or len(parent_headings) >= 3:
        guidance = "Turn into comprehensive but terse Markdown section. Use only headings deeper than parent_headings."
        signature = dspy.Signature("parent_headings: list[str], content_chunks -> subsection", guidance)
        return dspy.ChainOfThought(signature)(parent_headings=parent_headings, content_chunks=chunks).subsection

    # 2. Otherwise, summarize each chunk in parallel. This will help build up a Table of Contents.
    produce_gist = parallelize(dspy.Predict("parent_headings: list[str], chunk -> gist"))
    chunk_gists = produce_gist([{'parent_headings': parent_headings, 'chunk': c} for c in chunks])

    # 3. Given all chunk gists, prepare the next level of the Table of Contents.
    produce_headers = dspy.ChainOfThought("parent_headings: list[str], chunk_gists -> content_headings: list[str]")
    headers = produce_headers(parent_headings=parent_headings, chunk_gists=chunk_gists).content_headings
    print(headers)

    # 4. Assign each chunk to its sub-section, in parallel.
    classify = dspy.ChainOfThought(f"parent_headings: list[str], chunk -> topic: Literal{headers}")
    topics = parallelize(classify)([{'parent_headings': parent_headings, 'chunk': c} for c in chunks])

    # 5. Group the chunks into their sections.
    sections = {topic: [] for topic in headers}
    for topic, chunk in zip(topics, chunks):
        sections[topic.topic].append(chunk)

    # 6. Recursively process each section as a collection of chunks.
    prefix = "#" * (len(parent_headings) + 1) + " "
    summarized_sections = parallelize(structure_and_summarize)(
        [{'parent_headings': parent_headings + [prefix + topic], 'chunks': section_chunks}
         for topic, section_chunks in sections.items() if section_chunks]
    )

    # 7. Collect the sub-sections together. TODO: Do a sequential editing pass afterward!
    return "\n\n".join([parent_headings[-1]] + summarized_sections)

# Usage.
content = structure_and_summarize(
    parent_headings=["Welcome to the DSPy Documentation."],
    chunks=pages_in_the_DSPy_documentation,
)
```

## How to make this run

```python
import dspy
from typing import Literal
# Define or import parallelize, e.g.:
# from my_parallel_utils import parallelize
```

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "dspy>=0.1.0"
]
```

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def parallelize(fn, max_workers=8):
    def wrapper(args_list):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
            results = list(executor.map(lambda args: fn(**args), args_list))
        return results
    return wrapper

```

### Reflection on the DSPy Parallel Sub-Agent Pattern

This document showcases a highly sophisticated **"Fractal Processing Pattern"** using DSPy, which is notable for its:

-   **Intelligent Load Balancing**: Dynamically distributes work based on content complexity.
-   **Hierarchical Structure Building**: Naturally creates detailed, multi-level content outlines.
-   **Dynamic Parallelization**: Efficiently leverages concurrent execution for I/O-bound LLM operations.
-   **Adaptive Logic**: Base cases prevent infinite recursion and handle varying content sizes gracefully.

This approach is more advanced than typical chunking or static agent patterns, offering superior flexibility and scalability for complex document processing.

**Recommendations for Modern DSPy Practices (2025):**

To align with the latest DSPy (v2.6+) and general AI system best practices, consider:

1.  **Class-Based Signatures**: Replace string-based signatures with `dspy.Signature` classes for better type safety and clarity.
2.  **DSPy's Native Parallelization (where applicable)**: While your custom `parallelize` is effective for this recursive flow, explore `dspy.Parallel` for simpler, single-module parallel execution.
3.  **Enhanced Robustness**: Integrate `dspy.Refine` or `dspy.BestOfN` for built-in error handling and self-correction.
4.  **Optimization**: Utilize DSPy's teleprompters (e.g., `MIPROv2`, `BootstrapFewShot`) to automatically optimize prompts and few-shot examples.
5.  **Caching**: Leverage `dspy.configure_cache()` to reduce redundant LLM calls.

This "Fractal Processing Pattern" is a powerful demonstration of how DSPy can build highly dynamic, scalable, and semantically aware multi-agent systems, aligning with cutting-edge AI architecture trends.
