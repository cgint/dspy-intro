Notes on Linear and AI Agents

1. **The Valley of Integration:** You have to go through the pain of manual workflows before you reach the enlightenment of automation. Linear started slow with AI, waiting until models were good enough to build real value rather than rushing to slap "AI" on everything.
2. **Invisible Agents Are Often the Most Powerful:** The best AI doesn't announce itself - it just makes things happen under the hood. Linear's automatic triaging system works in the background, taking minutes per issue to find duplicates and provide context without you even noticing.
3. **Communication Is the Foundation:** Linear isn't just an issue tracker - it's fundamentally a communication tool. The entire product development cycle flows through discovery, planning, building, and shipping, with AI enhancing each step rather than replacing the human elements.
4. **Delegate, Don't Abdicate:** The most effective way to use AI agents is to maintain human ownership while delegating specific tasks. Linear mandates that a person owns each issue, but they can delegate work to coding agents - maintaining accountability while leveraging automation.
5. **Custom Instructions Are Everything:** The difference between mediocre and exceptional AI is often in the prompting. Linear provides custom instructions for all their AI tools, allowing you to append prompts with your company's specific language and workflows instead of forcing everyone into the same box.
6. **Slack Is Where Work Actually Happens:** The most transformative integration isn't always the most complex. Linear's Slack agent changed internal workflows completely by making it effortless to create issues directly from conversations - because that's where the real discussions are happening.
7. **Agents Need First-Class Citizenship:** For AI to truly integrate into workflows, it needs proper representation in the UI. Linear is building custom interfaces and concepts to make the experience more "agent-native" rather than forcing AI into human-designed paradigms.
8. **The Best Automation Starts With Manual Processes:** Linear's approach evolved from basic keyword search to semantic search to full agentic loops. You can't automate what you don't understand, and sometimes you need to do things manually before you can effectively delegate to machines.
9. **Orchestration Is the Next Frontier:** The future isn't just about individual agents but how they work together. Soon Linear will orchestrate workflows where you command one agent that then delegates to other agents - just like a manager assigns tasks to a team.
10. **Your Website Can Just Be Emissions of Life:** The most effective tools reflect how people actually work rather than forcing idealized workflows. Linear aims to be a natural extension of your existing processes, adapting to how you communicate rather than dictating how you should work.
